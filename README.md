# Full-Stack Application Deployment on DigitalOcean Kubernetes 🌐🚀

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **React frontend** and a **Node.js/Express backend** on a production server, hosted on **DigitalOcean Kubernetes**. The application is fully integrated with **Jenkins** for automated **CI/CD pipelines**.

## Project Overview 🎯

The main goal of this project is to establish seamless communication between the frontend and backend, and deploy the full application on a **DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster** for scalability and high availability.

---

## Features ✨

- **Frontend**: Built with **React** for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Developed using **Node.js** and **Express** for handling API requests.
- **CI/CD Integration**: **Jenkins** automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- **Kubernetes**: The application is hosted on a **DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster** to ensure scalability and efficient traffic management.

---

## Architecture 🏗️

- **Frontend**: React application served as static files, communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express API, serves frontend files in production.
- **Kubernetes**: The application is hosted on a **DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster**, with load balancing to distribute traffic.
- **CI/CD**: **Jenkins** automates build, test, and deployment processes.
